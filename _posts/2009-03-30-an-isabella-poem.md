# The Feeling of Comfort

Comfort is light blue   
Like the sky on a clear day  
And also like a day at the beach.  

It embraces my mind  
It reminds me of the crisp scent of fresh linen.  

It makes me feel content, like a small child with no worries  
It makes me want to share the feeling with everyone.
