Ergonomic API
* small API
* easy to impliment

16ms execution time
be tenacious and set a performance budget
performance monitoring should be a part of the dev cycle
avoid technical debt
skeleton screen?

#5 Performance Alerting Tools
nagios for monitoring performance
graphite stores raw data
performance regressions
actionable alerts
alert on improvements
