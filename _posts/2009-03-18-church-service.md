# Church Service

A very nice service.  It made me think about the book I read in college - The Psychology of the Beatitudes.  
I don’t remember the specifics of that book, but remember its cover and author like it was yesterday.

Interesting - when you look at the word beat itudes - Hey, Jack Kerouac  

Blessed are the poor in spirit…
