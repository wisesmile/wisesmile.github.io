Mark: screamin’  
Mark: thumpin  
Matt: i know  
Mark: rockin’ out  
Matt: i guess it seems contrived  
Matt: he was a drummer  
Matt: drummers are not front men  
Matt: and he does commercials  
Matt: or guest appearances on food network  
Mark: lol  
Matt: that’s not rock  
Mark: even rockers gotta eat, man  
Mark: imagine having to eat food cooked in a microwave everyday  
Mark: all year  
Mark: every year  
Matt: i bet he’s got a pretty big nest egg  
Mark: even thanksgiving dinner  
Mark: i’m sure he’s loaded  
Matt: who does that  
Matt: you ever see the riders these guys carry  
Mark: but he’s singing and playing the drums at the mean fiddler  
Mark: which is awesome  
Mark: and it ROCKS!

Matt: he really dug it  
Matt: kept shaking his head saying, this is really cool  
Mark: that’s how i felt when my mom said she’d buy me the zoso shirt  
Mark: i was so pumped and dumbfounded  
Matt: yup  
Mark: well, awesome  
Mark: :)  
Mark: hank rules  
Mark: do you have some ramones?  
Matt: of course  
Matt: do i have ramones

Matt: great stuff  
Matt: needles and pins?

Mark: i’ll dig the stuff out and check and listen  
Mark: :)  
Matt: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__F5bfTJlfY  
Mark: i can only listen to so much of the ramones  
Matt: i had to run away, yeah  
Matt: still it begins  
Matt: needles and pins  
Matt: because of all my pride  
Matt: the tears i got to hide  
Matt: i thought i was smart  
Matt: i stole her heart  
Matt: perfect tune  
Matt: i love the key change  
Matt: so amazing  
Mark: you listen to band of horses?  
Mark: yeah you did  
Mark: nevermind  
Matt: non stop  
Matt: for about a week  
Mark: i’m still hung-up on Marry Song  
Matt: then i listened to 4 springsteen records when i got to jersey and driving around  
Matt: started with wild and the innocent and worked my way through to the rising  
Matt: not to sound like a fem, but it makes me cry - i have to hide it from the kids  
Matt: ridiculuous  
Mark: lol  
Matt: “Needles and Pins” is a song by Jack Nitzsche and Sonny Bono, originally recorded by Jackie DeShannon. Other hit versions of the song were recorded by The Searchers, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers with Stevie Nicks and by the Ramones.  
Mark: the older i get, the easier it is to get choked up  
Matt: Jack and Sonny  
Matt: i had no idea  
Mark: gotta wipe my eyes all too often  
Matt: word  
Mark: overwhelming joy, mostly  
Mark: a real connection with the meta  
Matt: i’m not sure i can tell the difference anymore  
Matt: joy, saddness, fear, elation  
Mark: well, joy and elation make you cry  
Matt: for sure  
Mark: and saddness and fear usually make you angry or despondant  
Matt: i guess what i’m saying now, is that the ability to peg it to something has become irrelevant  
Matt: it just is  
Mark: nah  
Mark: it’s true that it just is  
Matt: word  
Mark: but being able to tell the difference and feeling all of it to the fullest is the magic of life  
Matt: henry just landed a big role in a gig at school doing higher and higer  
Mark: the magic of the form  
Matt: i guess that’s what i mean  
Matt: feeling all of it without labeling it  
Matt: the tears are magic  
Matt: and the springsteen tears are equally about not being there as they are of driving across the state line one more time with the kids in tow
Mark: fair enough, a label is unnecessary  
Matt: the moment  
Mark: the moment
