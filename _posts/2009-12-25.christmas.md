# Christmas Day

I’ve got Krishna Das playing on the big speakers. Hari Om. Christmas Day, waking up in an empty house is a strange thing. No outward signs of the holiday here - but that’s not to say its not recognized. Lots of things lately to stop and make me wonder. People with loving thoughts and smiles. Little kids in the back of cars, waving as they pass. Long forgotten friends commenting on my facebook ramblings. Empty parking lots - one car mine. Falling asleep at 7 waking at 9 falling asleep again. Garageband expertise. Road trips north, fedex costing too much. Rama Rama Hari Hari.”
